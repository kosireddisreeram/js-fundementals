var is the old way of declaring the variables

let and const variable declaration were introduced in latest es6 features.
var:
we declare the variables using the let where we can change the values 
example: price of the goods.
const:
the variable declared with const cannot be changed.
const A=10;
const A=30;
once the variable assigned with the const cannot be changed.
